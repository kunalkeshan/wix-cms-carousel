# Wix CMS Carousel

Setup a custom styled carousel on an external website that fetches data from Wix CMS API and map it to carousel items. Then, embed the carousel in your Wix website using an HTML embed code inside an iframe element.

## Embedding Site as an Iframe

To embed a site as an iframe into the Wix editor, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Elements:** In the Wix editor, navigate to the "Add Elements" panel.
2. **Select "Embed Code":** Scroll down and click on the "Embed Code" option.
3. **Select "Embed a Site":** Choose the "Embed a Site" option from the "Embed Code" menu.
4. **Paste the Site URL:** In the "HTML Settings" pop-up, select "Website address" and enter the URL of the site you want to embed.

After embedding the site, adjust the width and height of the embed to fit your page requirements.
